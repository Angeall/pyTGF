# List of tasks to do

## Game engine

- Add "laps" between actions. Real time = one lap for every controller. Turn-based = one lap per player
- Add a time limit to the Bots => fire warning when bot exceeded the limit.
- Fix the "can't quit the game" problem when exiting the `pygame` window while the `tkinter` end window is opened

## Examples

- Add comments
- Add a setting feature to Sokoban: Select the board

## GUI

- Add an optional settings page (as a button beneath the launch game button)
